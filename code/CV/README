Notice that the code has a variable SAMP_SIZE that I kept so I could be able to run the script in my machine. Consider to uncomment that variable and the line that uses it if you want to run this in your computer. If SAMP_SIZE is not commented, only 20 pictures of each class are used for creating the cv-folds.

The output of the program are NOT the pictures themselfs but the path to were the picture is located. Here is an example:

---> We consider cv_data to be the output of the program.

---> cv_data[n] will allow us to access the specific train and test sets of the n-cross-validation.

---> cv_data[0][0] will allow us to access the training set for the first cross-validation.
---> cv_data[0][1] will allow us to access the validation set for the first cross-validation.

---> cv_data[0][0] and cv_data[0][1] are made of tuples [path, class] where 'path' is the path to the image and 'class' is the name of the fish class (we probably want to change this at some point and define each class as a number).
