The file dayNight.txt contains the output of the script. The values 0 and 1 indicate the cluster to which the picture belongs. Each line corresponds to one class of fish (ALB (1), BET(2), DOL(3), LAG(4), NoF(5), OTHER(6), SHARK(7), YFT(8))

Notice that, since we are using a KNN algorithm for clustering, the value "1" does not always correspond to night pictures. We could easily change that if we finally use the script in the pipeline.

In the example file, the value "0" refers to normal pictures and value "1" to night pictures.
